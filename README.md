# Frogger Arcade Game for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree
This is my first attempt at javascript object-oriented programming.

## Instructions
There are two ways to successfully launch and start playing the game.
1. [Click here to launch the game online!] (https://infiniteerrors.github.io/Project3_FroggerGame/)
2. Download / clone the source files and open the index.html file in your browser of choice.

Use the arrow keys left,right,up,down to move the character towards the water to collect points. Along the way you can also collect a gleaming orange gem!
